        "Comfy but a little energy-expensive, Giedt's energy use intensity of 75 is notably above the classroom average - perhaps surprising considering it was built in 2007.",
        "Designed by BAR Architects and certified LEED Platinum in 2013, the SCC, while deservedly popular, is a chronic underperformer on its energy goals."
